# Pokemon-Battle-Frontier
This is a personal project based on the famous game franchise Pokémon. More specifically, this program will attempt to recreate the inner workings of how a traditional Pokémon battle is calculated and performed. Mechanics like damage taken by poison, attack reduction when burned and other things are reference through the Pokémon wiki but are still recreated in the program using original code. Without any proper experience in game coding or professional code outside school projects, this project will serve as a introduction for me to somewhat think like a game developer and give me an opportunity to problem solve on a much larger scale that what was experience in my early programming courses.
